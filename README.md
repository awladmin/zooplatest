Test for zoopla

Feedback:

Enjoyed the test. Took about a day (quite a bit longer than the hour I was told :), maybe I'm not that fast. ). 

The property images didn't load (404) so I changed the mock response to a sample house image take from the live site. A couple of agents logos didn't work either but I've left them, maybe they would work from testing internally at zoopla.
