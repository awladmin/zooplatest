Test for zoopla

Feedback:

I enjoyed the test, it took about a day (a bit longer than the hour I was told :), maybe I'm not that fast. ). 

The property images didn't load (404) so I changed the mock response to a sample house image taken from the live site. A couple of agents logos didn't work either but I've left them, maybe they would work from testing internally at zoopla.

I used SASS for the CSS and the client side javascript I did in ES6 with functional composition.

I created a watch task for the SASS to compile "npm watch-css" which will build the SASS and run the already given "npm run dev"

I didn't get time to run much cross device testing, as I'm using css grid I know theres a few cross device issues which would need a fix.

Thanks for reviewing.
